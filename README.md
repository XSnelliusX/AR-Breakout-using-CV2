# AR Breakout Game

This repository contains an Augmented Reality (AR) version of the classic game **Breakout**. In this version, the traditional static platform at the bottom of the screen is replaced by a dynamic, interactive platformâ€”**your hand**! Specifically, a line is drawn between your thumb and index finger, allowing you to control the paddle in real-time.

## Features

- **Hand-controlled paddle**: Instead of using a keyboard or mouse, the paddle is controlled by tracking your hand movements. A virtual line between your thumb and index finger acts as the platform to bounce the ball.
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Using computer vision and hand tracking, the game leverages your camera feed to create an interactive AR experience.
- **Classic Breakout gameplay**: Break the bricks by bouncing the ball off your hand-controlled paddle while avoiding the ball falling off the screen.

## How it Works

- The game uses the **MediaPipe Hands** solution to detect and track the position of your hand and OpenCV for the rest like drawing the Ball.
- A line is drawn between the tip of your thumb and index finger, which serves as the paddle in the game.
- You move your hand in front of the camera to control the paddle, bouncing the ball to break bricks.

## Requirements

To run the game, you'll need the following:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **OpenCV** for real-time computer vision
- **MediaPipe** for hand tracking

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XSnelliusX/AR-Breakout-using-CV2.git
cd AR-Breakout-using-CV2
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python ar_breakout.py
```

Make sure your webcam is enabled, as the game uses real-time video feed to track your hand movements.

## Gameplay Controls

- **Move your hand**: Place your hand in front of the camera, and adjust the position of your thumb and index finger to control the paddle. 
- **Avoid missing the ball**: Just like in the original game, prevent the ball from falling off the screen by bouncing it with your virtual paddle.
- **Break all bricks**: The goal is to break all the bricks on the screen using the ball.
